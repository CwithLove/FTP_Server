# Mini Project File Transfer Protocol

## Introduction
The mini-ftp project

This lab aims to develop a simple FTP application that allows file exchange between a client and a server. 

The goal is to become familiar with essential system calls (process management, socket communication, I/O redirection) and to implement a reliable file transfer protocol.
